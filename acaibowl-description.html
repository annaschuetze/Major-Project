  <p>While acai bowls are relatively new in the United States, they've been a staple in Brazil since, well forever. Acai is a purple berrylike fruit of a palm tree native to Central and South America. It's packed with antioxidants (anthocyanins) and omega-3 fatty acids. We used unsweetened frozen puree, which has a pleasant flavor with slight olive oil notes. Add the traditional toppings and this bowl is loaded with fiber.</p>
