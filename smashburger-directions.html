<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place the patties: You start by placing two two-ounce patties on the surface of a hot (and I mean hot) griddle. These are relatively high-fat patties (around 25% fat), made with a combination of short rib, brisket, and sirloin.</li>
  
  <li>Smash the patties: We tried a whole host of instruments for smashing our patties before settling on a plastering trowel, which is essentially a steel plate attached to a wooden handle. It gives you good leverage, which is important—remember, we're smashing petite two-ounce patties down to a size that's wide enough to fit on a standard burger bun.One of the real keys here is to use an ungreased surface. You want the meat to stick, so as to maximize contact points for browning.</li>
  
  <li>Season the patties: Next up, the patties get seasoned with salt and pepper. When you've got great beef, this is the only additional flavoring it needs. Think of it as a suit and tie for your patties.</li>
  
  <li>Scrape the patties: After just about 30 seconds, the burgers are ready to scrape. One of the great things about the Miraclean griddle is that it heats almost completely through conduction. That is, you have to come into direct contact with it to feel its heat—you can hold your hand inches away from its surface and not feel a thing. This means that while your crust is developing, the upper portions of the patty don't cook as fast as they would on a standard griddle.To scrape up the browned bits in the burgers, we use a heavy-duty scraper with a four-inch razor blade, pressing down on it firmly and working around the patty to make sure every last bit of flavor is lifted from that griddle.</li>
  
  <li>Flip and add cheese: After flipping the burger, a slice of American (or cheddar) cheese is added to one of the patties, and the second patty is placed directly on top. This way, the cheese gets heated from both sides simultaneously and rapidly melts, helping the patties stay together on their trip to the bun.</li>
  
  <li>Stack and go: Here's the thing with ultra-smashed burgers: As with all decisions you make in life, this one comes with a tradeoff. You're never gonna achieve the true medium-rare center that you can get with a bigger, fatter burger. The patties are simply too thin. This means that yes, your burgers come out a little bit drier. But, there are ways to minimize that effect.For one thing, the patties are cooked almost 100% unilaterally. That is, they spend most of their time with one side down, developing that massive crust. Once you flip them, you've got to work as quickly as possible—that second side should cook for no more than a few seconds.That center layer of cheese is also of vital importance, providing fat and moisture in each bite.</li>
